This is fork of [@davidsulc](https://github.com/davidsulc) explanatory [project](https://github.com/davidsulc/structuring-backbone-with-requirejs-and-marionette)
for his book - [using RequireJS with Marionette.js](https://leanpub.com/structuring-backbone-with-requirejs-and-marionette).

I've stumbled upon this project, while I was searching information about building applications with backbone and marionette,
and decided to take it as a starting point.

Changes in this version include:
- added grunt and bower functionality from yeoman backbone generator, 
- bootstrap upgraded to 3rd version
- jquery-ui dependency replaced with bootstrap.modal
